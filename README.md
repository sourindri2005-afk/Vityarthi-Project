# Vityarthi-Project
This project is a Humanized Console-Based Inventory Management System designed for a small Clothes Store. This Python program is like a digital notebook or assistant for a clothes store manager. It runs right in your computer's terminal (the text window) and helps you keep track of all the items on your shelves.
